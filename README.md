## ✨ Overview

NotOut99 allows users to engage deeply with cricket matches by leveraging their knowledge to build winning fantasy teams. The platform consists of two main components:

1.  **`notout99` (Mobile App):** A cross-platform application built with React Native and Expo for a seamless user experience on iOS and Android.
2.  **`NotOut99-Server` (Backend):** A robust Node.js server using Express.js, MongoDB for data storage, Twilio for secure OTP verification, and the Entity Sports API for real-time cricket data.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Ensure a MongoDB server instance is running locally or accessible)
* [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/): `npm install --global expo-cli`
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* A Twilio Account (for SID, Auth Token, Phone Number/Service SID)
* An Entity Sports API Key

### ⚙️ Server Setup (`NotOut99-Server`)

1.  **Navigate to the server directory:**
    ```bash
    # From the project root directory
    cd NotOut99-Server
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Create `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `NotOut99-Server` root directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if available) or add the following variables, replacing placeholders with your actual credentials:
    ```dotenv
    # .env configuration for Backend Server

    PORT=8000
    MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string> # e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/notout99
    
    # JWT Secrets (use strong, random strings)
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<your-strong-jwt-access-secret>
    REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=<your-strong-jwt-refresh-secret>
    
    # Twilio Credentials
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<your-twilio-account-sid>
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-twilio-auth-token>
    TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=<your-twilio-phone-number-or-messaging-service-sid> 

    # Entity Sports API Key
    ENTITY_SPORTS_API_KEY=<your-entity-sports-api-key> 
    ```
    *Note: Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible via the `MONGODB_URI`.*

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:8000`. Check the console output for the exact address.

### 📱 Mobile App Setup (`notout99`)

1.  **Navigate to the mobile app directory:**
    ```bash
    # From the project root directory
    cd notout99 
    # If you are already in NotOut99-Server: cd ../notout99
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Create `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `notout99` root directory and add the base URL of your running backend server:
    ```dotenv
    # .env configuration for Mobile App
    API_BASE_URL=http://<your-local-ip-address>:8000/api 
    # Replace <your-local-ip-address> with your machine's IP on the network 
    # Or http://localhost:8000/api if testing only on simulator/emulator on the same machine
    # Or your deployed backend URL if applicable
    ```
    *Important: If running the app on a physical device, use your computer's local network IP address, not `localhost`.*

4.  **Start the Expo development server:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    Follow the instructions in the terminal to open the app:
    * Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your physical iOS or Android device.
    * Press `a` to open in an Android emulator/device.
    * Press `i` to open in an iOS simulator.

**Key Improvements:**

1.  **Badges:** Added relevant technology/status badges at the top for a professional look. (Remember to replace placeholder links/info).
2.  **Emojis:** Used emojis sparingly to make headings and feature lists more engaging.
3.  **Clearer Structure:** Used horizontal rules (`---`) to visually separate major sections.
4.  **Enhanced Overview:** Slightly expanded the introduction and clearly listed the two main components.
5.  **Improved Screenshots Section:** Used `<p align="center">` and `hspace` within `<img>` tags for better control and centering, removed the duplicate row, and used percentage widths for better responsiveness on different screen sizes. Added line breaks (`<br/><br/>`) for better visual separation between rows.
6.  **Detailed Features:** Used bolding and slightly more descriptive language in the feature lists, separating mobile and server features clearly.
7.  **Dedicated Tech Stack Section:** Consolidated all technologies into one easy-to-find section. Added placeholders for common mobile state management libraries.
8.  **Refined Getting Started:**
    * Clearly separated Server and Mobile setup.
    * Provided more explicit instructions for `.env` files, including example values and notes (like using local IP for mobile testing).
    * Included the potentially missing `ENTITY_SPORTS_API_KEY` in the server `.env`.
    * Used more specific `bash` and `dotenv` language tags for code blocks.
9.  **Standard Sections:** Added common sections like "Contributing," "License," and "Contact" with placeholder content. You should create the corresponding `LICENSE` file and potentially a `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
10. **Links:** Added links to the official websites for the prerequisites.

Remember to replace placeholder information (like repository URLs, contact info, license details, build status badge link, etc.) with your actual project details.
